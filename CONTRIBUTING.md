# Contributing to USWDS web components

Thank you for your interest in contributing to USWDS web components.

> [!Important]
> **This repo is currently in beta and is not yet ready for community code contributions.**
> 
> While the USWDS core team works through big decisions about architecture and style, we ask that you do not submit pull requests. Instead, we encourage you to contribute by your sharing your ideas, concerns, and questions with the USWDS core team and community.
> 
> The best way to contribute at this time is to install our beta components in your test environments and let us know how it goes. Learn more about how you can provide feedback in the [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue) and [starting a discussion](#starting-a-discussion) sections below.

## How can I contribute?

### Submitting an issue

If you have discovered a bug or have a new feature to suggest, let us know by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue). We’ll address it as soon as we are able (but because we are in beta, please be aware that it might be awhile).

### Starting a discussion

If you want to share ideas, questions, or concerns with the USWDS core team and community, [open a discussion on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart#creating-a-new-discussion).

### Submitting a pull request

At this time, we are not accepting code contributions in the community. We expect to open up community pull request submissions in early 2025, so check back later for instructions on how to contribute pull requests to USWDS web components.
